# PyTorch Segmentation Models Zoo
All models here were either written from scratch or refactored from open-source implementations.
All models here use `Activated Normalization` layers instead of traditional `Normalization` followed by `Activation`. It makes changing activation function and normalization layer easy and convenient. It also allows using [Inplace Activated Batch Norm](https://github.com/mapillary/inplace_abn) from the box, which is essential for reducing memory footprint in segmentation tasks.


## Encoders
All [models](../models/) could be used as feature extractors (aka backbones) for segmentation architectures. Almost all combinations of backbones and segm.model are supported.


## Features
* Unified API. Create `Unet, SegmentaionFPN, HRnet` models using the same code
* Support for custom number of input channels in pretrained encoders
* All core functionality covered with tests
